firmware:
+investigate issue where arduino reports "false" current position readings after a long time active or possibly after doing multiple re-calibration routines 
+add additional error state reporting from arduino
+make arduino turn off motor a few seconds after a do_seek command is completed (allow freewheeling in between seek attempts)
+investigate issue where motor tries to seek "random" position after additional re calibration routine complete (possibly trying to seek old target value?)
+consider implmenting esphome decide on esp8266 instead of esp32 (esp32 is overkill here as its basically just SPI bridge) 
+return error when position is requested and not currently calibrated (arduino)

hardware:
+figure out solution for battery power/charging 
+create new d-shaft pulley
+create new case/base-plate 

long term/lofty:
+intvestigate if possible to re-implement arduino side of code (motor managemant) directly on esp32/8266
	+how fast can interrupts be handled?
	+can it keep track of motor position accurately?
